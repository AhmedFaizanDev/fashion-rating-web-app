- Built with TensorFlow for machine learning model integration.
- Simple and clean user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Flask

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmedFaizanDev/fashion-rating-web-app.git
   cd fashion-rating-web-app
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you donâ€™t have \`requirements.txt\` yet, you can create it with:

   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download or create a TensorFlow model file.**

   Ensure you have a file named \`fashion_rating_model.h5\` in the root directory. This is a placeholder for your TensorFlow model.

4. **Run the Flask application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the web application:**

   Open your web browser and navigate to \`http://127.0.0.1:5000/\`.

## File Structure

- \`app.py\`: The main Flask application file.
- \`model.py\`: The script used to create and train the TensorFlow model.
- \`static/\`: Contains static files such as CSS and JavaScript.
  - \`styles.css\`: The CSS file for styling the web page.
  - \`script.js\`: The JavaScript file for handling the form submission.
